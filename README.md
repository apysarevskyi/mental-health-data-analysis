# Mental Health Data Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of mental health data, focusing on identifying factors influencing mental well-being and stress levels. The dataset used for this analysis can be found here: [Kaggle - Mental Health Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/mental-health-dataset).

## Key aspects of this project include:

* Exploring associations between mental health conditions and demographic variables such as gender, occupation, and family history.
* Investigating the impact of mental health history, coping struggles, and access to care options on stress levels.
* Visualizing trends in mental health-related factors and their influence on growing stress levels.
* Applying statistical methods, including Chi-Square tests and correlation analysis, to understand relationships and draw insights from the data.
